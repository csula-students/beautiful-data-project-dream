# Homework 2

> This is your first team project. Please do form a team of 2 to 3 before you start your homework 2!

## Due data

<b style="color: #F44336; font-size: 17px;">April 24th midnight</b>

## Updated requirements after 4/17

Make sure you data satisfies at least 2Vs out of 3Vs of Big Data below:

* Volume

> At least **500MB** worth of total data size at this stage  
> If you successfully meet the requirements we have earlier as **3GB**, you get bonus *2 points* in this homework

* Velocity

> Real time data. Usually you can only accomplish this requirement through API client like Twitter streaming API.

* Variety

> At least have **3 data source** to provide data to you (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, CNN News ... etc. -- each of them counts toward one data source)

## Description

In this homework, your job is to acquire data by implementing our data collector interface with your own detail. This may involves you to download data using Http request library, to do web scraping or to make some API calls.

This implementation may vary a lot between all teams depending on the data source you are getting from. For example, a team who wants to get Twitter tweets to compute trending will have different implementation than a team who is getting data from bunch of sensors!

Since this homework is your first **team homework**, you will need to use Github by starting your team repository. This implies you will need to be able to use Git effectively enough to commit and push code to collaborate with your teammate(s) and instructor(s). If you find yourself having trouble of doing git, please utilize [this article][1] for your benefit or play with it on [this link][2]!

This homework will involve you to program your own acquiring process, which is important for you to follow up with your questions from homework 1. You will need to choose the question(s) to work for this team project with your team members. Once your team decided the question(s) from homework 1, please answer the questions below so we know what type of project your team is working on.

**Questions**

* What question(s) did you decide to work on as a team?
* What is your data source(s)?
* How long does it take for you to download data? Have you download complete data set?

> Please provide a screenshot on your total data size

* How large is your data (size wise and number of records wise)?
* Do you face any dirty data issue? If you do, how did you clean up your data?
* How do you store the data you downloaded?

**Testing**

Since we are downloading data from internet, how in the world we suppose to test our process!?

You don't have to test the whole process from end to end. Instead, think about what process can you simplify out to just Java programming and test only that part. In example, you may have a *model* to represent data like below:

```java
// import statements
public class Model {
  private final String id;
  private final String content;
  private final String city;
  private final int area;
  private final LocalDateTime timestamp;
  // constructors, getters, setters and other model related methods
}
```

Then my first question to you is to test data validity. Lets say if you read the data online as a String and construct your own data model. How do you handle the case of missing fields? Do you throw exceptions?

All these question can be tested with test case like:

```java
// import statements
public class ModelTest {
  @Test(expected=CityNotFoundException.class)
  public void TestCity() {
    String city = null;
    Model.setCity(city);
  }
}
```

In other word, think about all the edge cases and your Java collector implementation detail behavior before you start working on the code. Design an module that has clear defined dependencies so that it is testable.

But how do instructors measure your testing? I will set up the test coverage on each of your repository and see your test coverage number. I expect test coverage to be at least 30%. As long as the test coverage shows higher than 30%, you will get the test coverage points below.

## Tasks

* Create team repo
* Push commits to your own repo
* Implement your data collector
* Acquire data
* Store data in local file storage
* Answer questions in description of Pull Request

## Deliverables

* CSNS submission including team info and link to your repo
* Github pull request
  * Answer questions in the description of pull request
  * Implement data collector interfaces
  * Test your own data collector

## Grading rubric

* Github pull request [1 pt]
* Answer questions in description [2 pts]
* Satisfy at least 2Vs out of 3Vs [2 pts]
* Implement data collector [3 pts]
  * Implements **Collector** interface to mungee data and save data
  * Implements **Source** interface to download/parse data to memory
  * Save data into a file/data storage
> You should be able to run this data collector yourself to download data.  

* Testing your own data collector [2 pts]
> Have at least 30% code coverage

> P.s.  
> I will randomly ask a few teams to explain your code to me.  
> If you cannot explain your code (aka. answer my questions on how you implemented), I will take points off. Or worse, I will count you as copying code from someone else for not able to explain and thus giving you a **zero**.  
> The random team list will be announced at the class right before the homework submission deadline.
