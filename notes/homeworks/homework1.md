## Description

This homework is a individual homework; thus, please finish this homework by yourself.

In data science, we start the process by asking a good question. In homework 1, your job is to ask a specific question with some of your initial research.  In other word, you will need turn in a short write up for your question as homework 1.  Be sure to review the video on the [orders of knowledge][3] before completing this assignment.

You will need to answer the followings in your write up:

* What domain (area) will you explore for your project?
* What is the question you wish to answer?
* What data do you plan to use to support your statement above?
* What do you know about the data so far?
* Why did you choose this question?

A few characteristics of a good question:

* Clearly defined: question should be able to summarized in single statement.
* As focus as possible: question should have a narrow focus rather than broad approach.
* Reasonable data available: you should be able to find data set to support up your question.
* Should be able to reach the third level knowledge - predict the future.
