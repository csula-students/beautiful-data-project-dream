## Python

Please install [Python 2](https://www.python.org/). Please just download 2.7 for this class not version 3.

> For Mac user, use `brew install python`  

Python, one of the top two common languages choice for data science. Why?

Many libraries are written in python. This includes machine learning libraries like [Sci-kit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) or [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)

So why is Python popular?

* Easy to learn
* Easy to get it up and running
* Syntax is very close to pseudocode
* Interpreted languages (have interpreter built in)

In the following session, we will introduce python from the ground up.

### Syntax

Not like Java, python doesn't have bracket. Python uses **indentation** to detect code block.

What do I mean by indentation? Consider the following:

```python
x = 1

if x > 0:
  print "x is positive"
```

Now when the print statement is not indented properly. it will not be executed in the if statement.

Therefore, it is recommended for you to display all the invisible characters in your favorite text editor.

> Don't ask why your code doesn't work later because your code contain both hard tab and soft tab (4 spaces or 2 spaces)

### Variables and types

In python, to define variable, you don't need to specify types not like Java.

In other word, you can simply assign variable just like below:

```python
# Number
x = 1 + 1
# Boolean (keep it in mind that first character is capitalized)
t = True
# String
y = "Hello, world"
z = "Hello\nworld!"
multiline_string = """
this is multiline string
if you need to print out multiline
you may use three "
"""
concat_str = "Hello" + "," + "world!"
# You can treat word like list and get character(s) out this way
y[1] # e
y[0:2] # He

# List
li = [1, 2, 3]
li[0] # 1
li[:] # return shallow copy of the list
li[1] = 4 # list is now [1, 4, 3]
li.append(5) # list is now [1, 4, 3, 5]
li[2:3] = [] # list is now [1, 4, 5]
len(li) # 3

# nested list
li = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
```

# Control flow

Control flows includes if, for, while and function.

```python
# if statement doesn't need to be surrounded by parathesis
x = 1

if x > 0:
  print "x is positive"

# for 
li = [1, 2, 3]
for i in li:
  print i
# range
for i in range(10):
  print i # 0 ... 9
# range can also be specific range with lower-bound(inclusive) to upper-bound(exclusive)
for i in range(5, 10):
  print i # 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# break and continue
for i in range(100):
  if i > 10:
    break
  elif i % 2 == 0:
    continue
  else:
    print i
```

```python
# def is the keyword to define a function
def f(x, y):
  return x + y

f(1, 2) # 3

# python not like java can have default argument value
def g(x, y=1):
  return x + y

g(1) #2

# when calling function, it can provide keyword as argument
def h(x, y, z):
  print x
  print y
  print z
  return x + y - z

h(y=2,x=6,z=10)

# lambda
def l(x):
  return lambda n: n + x

f = l(42)
f(8) # 50

# documentation for function
def messy(z):
  """
  this is a documentation example
  """
  return z + 42

print messy.__doc__
```

### Data structure

**List**

* list.append(x)
  * Add an item to the end of list
* list.extend(anotherList)
  * Extend list from another list
* list.insert(i, x)
  * Insert item x into position i e.g. insert to front of list `list.insert(0, item)`
* list.remove(x)
  * remove the **first** item of value x
* list.pop([i])
  * pop certain item from the list of index i. If no argument is given, pop the last item
* list.index(x)
  * return index of item x
* list.sort()
* list.reverse()

**List as stack**

```python
stack = [3, 4, 5]
stack.append(6)
stack.append(7)
stack
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
stack.pop()
7
stack
[3, 4, 5, 6]
stack.pop()
6
stack.pop()
5
stack
[3, 4]
```

**List as queue**

```python
from collections import deque
queue = deque(["Eric", "John", "Michael"])
queue.append("Terry")           # Terry arrives
queue.append("Graham")          # Graham arrives
queue.popleft()                 # The first to arrive now leaves
'Eric'
queue.popleft()                 # The second to arrive now leaves
'John'
queue                           # Remaining queue in order of arrival
deque(['Michael', 'Terry', 'Graham'])
```

**Functional programming with list** like filter, map and reduce

* filter  
```python
def f(x): return x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0
...
filter(f, range(2, 25))
[3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21, 24]
```
* map  
```python
def cube(x): return x*x*x
...
map(cube, range(1, 11))
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]
```
* reduce  
```python
seq = range(8)
def add(x, y): return x+y
...
map(add, seq, seq)
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
```

**Tuples**

We saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types â€” str, unicode, list, tuple, bytearray, buffer, xrange). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple.

A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:

```python
>>>
t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
t[0]
12345
t
(12345, 54321, 'hello!')
# Tuples may be nested:
... u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
u
((12345, 54321, 'hello!'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
# Tuples are immutable:
... t[0] = 88888
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
# but they can contain mutable objects:
... v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])
v
([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])
```

**Set**

Similar to list but with keyword `set`

```python
li = [1, 2, 3, 1]
se = set(li) # set([1, 2, 3])
1 in se # True
4 in se # False

# operation on sets
li2 = set([2, 3, 4])
# in se but not in li2
se - li2 # 1

# union
se | li2 # 1234

# interception
se & li2

# in a or b but not both
se ^ li2
```

**Dictionary**

Dictionary is like map in Java.

```python
tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}
tel['guido'] = 4127
tel

tel['jack']

del tel['sape']
tel['irv'] = 4127
tel

tel.keys()

'guido' in tel

# to loop through
for i, v in enumerate(['tic', 'tac', 'toe']):
  print i, v
```

### Modules

Each python file is essentially a module.

For instance,

```python
# my_math.py

def add(x, y):
  return x + y
```

```python
import my_math

my_math.add(1, 2)
```

**Python main method**

if you have a if statement like below, that block of code will not be executed when you import to other module.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
  import sys
  print sys.argv[1]
```

**Packages**

When your code base grows larger, you will need to think about how to organize your code. 

Python will treat folder with `__init__.py` as a package. Think of below:

```
main.py
acquisition/
  __init__.py
  collector.py
  source.py
storage/
  __init__.py
  mongo.py
```

Then in your `main.py` you can start import like below:

```python
# main.py
import acquisition.collector
import aqcuisition.source

while source.hasNext():
  collector.save(collector.munge(source.next()))
```

### File read/write

```python
f = open('file_name.extension', 'r') # second argument is for mode read or write or both!

f.read() # reads out the entire content
f.readline() # reads line by line

# below also works
for line in f:
  print line

f.write('Hello world!\n') # to write to file
```

### json

Json is built-in with Python!

```python
# write json string
json.dumps([1, 'simple', 'list'])

# dump json to a file
json.dumps([1, 'simple', 'list'], f)

# read json string from file
json.load(f)
```

### Exceptions

```python
while True:
  try:
    x = int(raw_input("Please enter a number: "))
    break
  except ValueError:
    print "Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again..."
```

### Classes

```python
class MyClass: # can defined inheritance MyClass(ParentClass, ParentClass2)
    """A simple example class"""
    i = 12345
    
    def __init__(self):
      print 'no arg constructor is called'

    def f(self): # first argument is always self
        return 'hello world'
```

### CSV

```python
import csv

with open('example.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:
  spamreader = csv.reader(csvfile)
  for row in spamreader:
    print ', '.join(row)
```
