# Data Science 2016

#### 21 April 2016

We notice that there are only 63 students on gitter while there are over 90 students in the class.  This is very alarming and very concerning for a number of reasons:

1. Students miss out on discussions and questions that can potentially help them.
2. Students are not participating in class discussion.
3. Students are not asking for help.

Here is a scenario to consider:

> At the end of the quarter a student said to the instructor: "sir, my grade for this class is very close, can you please give me some extra point?"

The answer is obviously no, because this student did not participate nor asked for help during the quarter.  This is sad because that the students could have seen the answer to a commonly asked question.  What is really tragic is that the student has to plead for a grade that s/he did not earn.

Here are a few comments on homework 1:

- Your question must be _specific_.  Broad question is difficult to conduct data analytic.  What's it can lead you down a path that is not tractable.  The result can be disastrous.

- Your question must third order in nature.  To be in third nature:
  - It must answer the `why` question.  In other words, your data analytic answers or explains the observation or assumption, or
  - It must perform some kind of prediction.  E.g. Given this condition can we predict a certain outcome.

- For those who answers first and order knowledge questions, it's not helpful and can put you in danger of not passing the course.

- A few of you do the following:
  - Taxi/uber prediction (our recommendation: don't do it -- pick something else)
  - Sports analytic (our recommendation: don't do it -- pick something else) 
  - Stock prediction (our recommendation: don't do it -- pick something else)

Ultimately it's up to you.  However, picking any of these three will receive extra scrutiny because someone is doing it, sports analytic is hard (borderline gambling), and stock prediction is a pipe dream.
